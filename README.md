## About
The **AniFox** is a project that was created with passion. It all started when a young person wanted to create their own version of an anime application, as every app with anime viewing capabilities had a large amount of advertising. It ended up evolving into a [diploma](https://github.com/DeNyWho/AniFoxKMP/blob/master/diplom/%D0%92%D0%9A%D0%A0.docx) project. This repository contains the final diploma kmp version. All the features of the new backend version part can be seen on the [website](https://anifox.club/anime).  The Android part of the KMP project was developed using the MVVM and SOLID architecture.
